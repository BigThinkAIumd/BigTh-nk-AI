## Testing
I would encourage everyone to view the website on different devices to test how responsive it is.

## Issues
- Hero section does not exactly look like the design; has different positioning and hero image has a slightly different color.

## Yet To Do
- Adding descriptions for the different sections within Pyoneers.
- Filling up email in footer.
- Filling up phone in footer.
- *Considering* changing pyoneers subdivs to be a slideshow for mobile view.
- *Considering* adding more content for EDGE section.
- *Considering* adding an 'Our Team' section or page.
- *Considering* removing phone option entirely from the footer.
- *Considering* replacing hero image.
